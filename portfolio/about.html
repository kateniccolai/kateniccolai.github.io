        <h1>About</h1>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        I’m Katherine Niccolai, a sophomore at High Point University with an interest in marketing, 
        communications, and digital media. My coursework in web design has allowed me to explore the 
        connections between marketing, public relations, and coding — helping me understand how digital 
        tools can enhance brand storytelling and engagement. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        In additon to my academics, I’ve built professional experience through roles in customer service, 
        sales, and event coordination. From lifeguarding at private country clubs to interning in property management 
        and assisting at high-end jewelry shows, I’ve developed strong interpersonal, organization, 
        and time management skills. As captain of my athletic team and a member of the Sports Management Association’s 
        social media team, I’ve also honed leadership and collaboration abilities that I bring into every project I take on.</p>
